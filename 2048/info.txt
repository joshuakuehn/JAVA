This program is my interpretation of the popular app 2048. (Currently under development)
This program will:
--use multi threading in an efficient way to reduce resource usage and improve responsiveness
--be compartmentalized in a modular way to allow directed updating without having to rewrite everything else
--act as a test bed for another program that I will write that will attempt to beat 2048 automatically
--have a blasted undo button
