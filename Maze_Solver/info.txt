This program solves a maze of any size and design using a variant of the A* algorithm to find the shortest path.
It is not generically constructed so it will only work on mazes built using the grid space I have designed.
It crudely uses multithreading to handle the creation, solution, and resetting of the maze space.
It will definitely be rewritten in an attempt to streamline the flow and organization of the logic.
